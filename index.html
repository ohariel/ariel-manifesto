    <h1>Ariel Oh: Manifesto</h1>
	<pre>
I sew because I choose to create
what cannot be found on racks or phone screens,
to take fabric and transform it, 
stitch by stitch,
thread by thread, 
hand by hand, 
imagining shapes that move with bodies, 
telling stories through every fold and seam, 
which is a beautiful process of creation.

I refuse the repetitveness of fast fashion,
the hollow trends,
the perfection that erases creativity, 
the speed that forgets care,
and I insist that designing is a process, 
slow and deliberate,
where imagination threads through fabric.
